# Olist — Brazilian E-Commerce Power BI Report

**Project:** Power BI report using the Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset (Kaggle)

---

## Project overview
This repository contains a Power BI report that demonstrates multi-table data modeling, exploratory analysis, and dashboarding for an e-commerce business. The report was built using the public **Olist — Brazilian E-commerce** dataset from Kaggle and is organized into three report pages:

1. **Sales Overview** — KPI cards, monthly sales trend, payment mix, top product categories, top products, and geographic sales view.  
2. **Customer Insights** — new vs repeat analysis, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), sentiment, and top customers.  
3. **Sales Decomposition** — revenue flow from geography → category → product → seller → payment.

## Important — Large files (dataset & .pbix)
The original Kaggle dataset and the final Power BI `.pbix` file were too large to include directly in this GitHub repository. Please download them from the links below:

# Insights & Recommendations  
**Olist — Brazilian E-commerce (Power BI Report)**

This document contains the key insights, interpretations, and recommended next steps derived from the Power BI report built on the Olist Brazilian e-commerce dataset.

---

## KPI snapshot
- Total sales  
- Total orders  
- Average order value  
- Total customers  
- Repeat customers  
- On-time delivery rate  
- Average review score

---

## YoY sales trend
- Identify YoY growth in sales from year 2016 to 2018.

## Monthly sales trend
- Identify peaks and dips (e.g., peak in **May–July**, dip in **September**, rebound in **November**).  
- **Action:** Investigate promotions, inventory/stock levels, or logistics incidents around months with abnormal movement (especially September).

---

## Payment mix
- Majority usage: **credit card**.  
- Second largest: **boleto**.
  
---

## Top categories
- `health_beauty`, `watches_gifts`, `bed_bath_table` drive most revenue.  
- **Action:** Prioritize inventory, merchandising, and targeted promotions for these categories.

---

## Customer Insights

### Total vs Repeat
- High acquisition but relatively low repeat count.  
- **Opportunity:** Implement retention programs (loyalty, targeted emails, incentives).

### CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)
- CLV indicates average customer worth.  
- **Action:** Use CLV segments to target campaigns and allocate marketing budget more efficiently.

### Sentiment
- Customer sentiment is **mostly positive**.  
- **Action:** Use positive sentiment to solicit more reviews/referrals; investigate negative feedback for product or service improvements.

### Top customers
- Revenue concentration among a subset of high spenders.  
- **Action:** Monitor concentration risk and consider VIP outreach, exclusive offers or retention programs for top customers.

---

## Sales Decomposition
- Flow view shows top states (e.g., **São Paulo**) and how they map to categories, products, sellers and payment types.  
- **Action:** Use decomposition to optimize logistics and fulfillment, prioritize high-performing sellers and product lines, and allocate marketing spend by geography.

---

## Key findings & recommendations (summary)
- Sales are concentrated in a few product categories and a few geographic regions (São Paulo is the largest). **Prioritize stock and fulfillment** in those regions.  
- New customer acquisition is strong but repeat purchase rate is low — **implement loyalty and win-back campaigns**.  
- **Investigate the September sales dip** (possible promotions, stockouts, or delivery issues).  
- Payment mix dominated by credit card — **review processing fees and strengthen fraud controls**.  
- Leverage positive sentiment to **request more reviews and referrals**; address root causes of negative sentiment.
